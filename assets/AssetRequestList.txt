Stamina bar:
when it hits 0, game over screen w/ Replay, skip, return to menu options, 0 stars and move counter

destructable rock = solid unless dynamite explodes near it. 

when dynamite ends on snow, nothing happens
when dynamite collides with a solid object it explodes
explosion will occur in the 8 spaces around it.

pushable rock = destroyed
solid stalactite = destroyed
under stalactite shadow = activates stalactite to fall
dynamite over crack, moves to next stage (like player).
dynamite into hole = disapears, no explosion
dynamite onto move plate = same as rock/player
dynamite onto tele pad = teleports and blocks pad from being used  until moved off. 
dynamite into light = changes light to destoryed light solid object that takes up a space but will not activate from pad

light: 
on levels with light, visability = player + 2 spaces
new pad: step on it to turn on lights
lights = new solid item that turns on and illuminates itself + 3 spaces or turns off when pad not blocked by player/rock/dynamite

Lantern: collect it to increase light radius around player by 1 space per lantern collected 
illuminates itself + 1 space
