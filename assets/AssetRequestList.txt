Programming Assets:
1. Stamina bar:
when it hits 0, game over screen w/ Replay, skip, return to menu options, 0 stars and move counter
size = 4*par to a maximum of 100
2. Dynamite:
destructible rock = solid unless dynamite explodes near it
when dynamite ends on snow, nothing happens
when dynamite collides with a solid object it explodes
explosion will occur in the 8 spaces around it.
If space = regular rock, nothing happens
destructible rock = destroyed
snowman = normal activation (melt)
tree = normal activation and destroyed
pushable rock = destroyed
solid stalactite = destroyed
under stalactite shadow = activates stalactite to fall
dynamite over crack, moves to next stage (like player)
dynamite into hole = splashes and vanishes, no explosion
dynamite onto move plate = same as rock/player
dynamite onto warp pad = teleports and blocks pad from being used until moved off
dynamite into light = changes light to destroyed light solid object that takes up a space but will not activate from pad
3. Light: 
on levels with light, visibility = player + 2 spaces
new pad: step on it to turn on lights
lights = new solid item that turns on and illuminates itself + 3 spaces or turns off when pad not blocked by player/rock/dynamite
4. Lantern: collect it to increase light radius around player by 1 space per lantern collected 
illuminates itself + 1 space
